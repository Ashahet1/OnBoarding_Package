# Onboarding_Package
This project turns messy GitHub documentation into a clean, readable onboarding handbook. Using Python, OpenAI, Streamlit, and a .NET + IronPDF backend, it automatically pulls Markdown files from a repo, summarizes them with AI, and generates a polished PDF that new developers can actually read from start to finish.
